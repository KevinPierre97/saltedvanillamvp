Preamble:

On September 25, 2024 the structure of the project has changed in order to better support the scope.

What once was, and what you might be used to, are four separate files you can add to for added functionality.

Those four files are: models.py, views.py, forms.py, and admin.py

They are now python packages: models, views, forms, and admin

They have been changed to make files length smaller and thus easier to understand.

This split was only done on mymainapp, because it is the main app and the others aren't important or nearly as long


----------------------------------------------

To update segments of a model, view, form, or admin view

Simply open the respective folder and click on the file with the name that makes most sense.

There you will find the code to update. Don't forget to save changes.

--------------------------------------

To add new models, views, forms, or admin views

Simply open the respective folder

Click on the file with the name that makes most sense.
If the new segment of code doesn't fit nicely in any previous file, feel free to create another .py python file

Type out the code. Import the segment into the respective __init__.py file. Add the name into __all__ if the segment
is to be imported for use in other sections of the project. Don't forget to save changes.

--------------------------------

Templates are stored in the templates file in the root folder, under the app name, and under the view file name

--------------------------------
Tips on file naming conventions:

Model files are named by topic
View files are named by topic

Admin views follow Model file naming
Template folders follow view file naming
